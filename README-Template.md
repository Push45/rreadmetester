# Movies With Friends

## Overview

Movies With Friends is a dynamic web application that allows registered users to create profiles, find movies that are in theaters and to find some one to go see a movie with them. We have all been in the situation of wanting to see a movie but having no one to actually see it with, this app works to fix that.
